/**
 * The client class dedicated to communicating with the server, via the https protocol for now
 * A quick documention why it's different from http :
 * When using an https connection, the server responds to the initial connection by offering a list of encryption methods
 * it supports. In response, the client selects a connection method, and the client and server exchange certificates
 * to authenticate their identities. After this is done, both parties exchange the encrypted information after ensuring
 * that both are using the same key, and the connection is closed. In order to host https connections, a server must have
 * a public key certificate, which embeds key information with a verification of the key owner's identity.
 * Most certificates are verified by a third party so that clients are assured that the key is secure.
 * Here however, our server has an auto signed certificate, so we must make sure that we still accept it.
